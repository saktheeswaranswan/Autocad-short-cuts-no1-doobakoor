To accurately measure curve length or any distance in a photo when the scale or real-world distance is known, you can use photogrammetry or image analysis software. Here are a few excellent tools that allow you to do this:
🔧 1. ImageJ (Fiji) – Free & Powerful

    What it is: A free, open-source image analysis software.

    Use: Import the image, set a known scale (e.g., known object size), then use the segmented line tool to trace curves and get the accurate length.

    Best for: Scientific/medical images, curve tracing, precision.

📐 2. AutoCAD (or DraftSight, LibreCAD) – CAD Approach

    What it is: CAD tools let you import photos, scale them based on a known dimension, and trace curves/edges using polylines or splines.

    Best for: Architectural, engineering, or accurate geometrical work.

    How to: Import image > scale image using a reference > trace curves using spline/polyline > use “Length” tool to get total curve distance.

📸 3. Digimizer – Simple GUI Tool for Photo Measurements

    What it is: A commercial software focused on measuring distances, angles, areas in images.

    Strengths: Easy interface, ideal for curved path measurements.

📷 4. Adobe Photoshop with Measurement Scale

    What it is: If you're using Photoshop, you can set a measurement scale using a known object in the image.

    How to: Use the Ruler tool and Paths to trace curves, then convert path length into real-world units based on your scale.

🛰️ 5. QGIS (Geospatial Tool) with Georeferenced Images

    What it is: For aerial or map photos, QGIS allows you to georeference an image and trace curves (like roads, rivers) to get real-world measurements.

    Use case: Urban planning, mapping, satellite photos.

If you're looking for something free and easy, go with ImageJ/Fiji.
If you want high design accuracy, go with AutoCAD.

Great choice! AutoCAD is perfect for accurate design measurements from an image, including curved lengths. Here's a step-by-step guide (with web links) to measure curve lengths from a photo using AutoCAD:
🧭 STEP 1: Insert Your Image into AutoCAD

    Open AutoCAD.

    Go to the Insert tab → Click on Attach.

    Browse and insert your image file (e.g., .jpg, .png) into the drawing area.

📘 Autodesk Guide:
👉 Insert an Image File
🧮 STEP 2: Scale the Image Using a Known Reference

If your image has a known object or dimension (like a ruler, doorway, etc.):

    Draw a Line over the known distance in the image.

    Use the DIST command to get the image-based length.

    Calculate the scale factor:
    Scale factor=Real-world lengthMeasured line length
    Scale factor=Measured line lengthReal-world length​

    Use the SCALE command:

        Select the image.

        Specify a base point.

        Enter the scale factor calculated above.

✏️ STEP 3: Trace the Curve

Now trace the curve using one of these tools:

    Polyline (PL) – best for sharp curves.

    Spline (SPL) – best for smooth flowing curves.

Just trace over the visible curve in your image.

📘 Autodesk Guide:
👉 Draw Spline
📏 STEP 4: Measure the Length of the Curve

    Select the traced spline or polyline.

    Type LIST or click Properties palette.

    Check the Length property – this is the real-world curved length!

📘 Autodesk Guide:
👉 LIST Command
Optional: Annotate or Export

    Use DIMLINEAR or DIMARC to label dimensions.

    Export drawings using PDFEXPORT or PLOT.
